## Generate cutout images

### Python functions
Basic and generic `python` functions are in `tiger_cutout_hsc.py`, which is written by Song Huang and requires `lsstpipe`. Functions include cone search around a given coordinate, generate cutout image and PSF, etc. **DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE UNLESS NECESSARY!**

### Scripts & Notebooks

- `s18a_batch_cutout.py`: This Python script is used for generate S18A cutout **for all objects in a catalog**, but it also has a useful function `batch_cutout`. This function reads the files in `'/tigress/HSC/DR/s18a_wide'` and save images and PSFs to a local folder `data_dir`. It is not recommended to donwload things to `/tigress/`, so I set `data_dir=/scratch/gpfs/jiaxuanl/Data/HSC/LSBG`. The catalog should have a column for "index". 

- `candy_sample/lsbg_cutout_s18a.sh`: Bash script for downloading test candy sample such as `LSB-Greco2018.fits` and `candy_sample_210313.fits`. Files will be downloaded to `$DATADIR/Cutout`. Index column is named `Seq`. The catalogs is generated in `candy_sample_cutout.ipynb` (adaptive cutout size based on magnitude and size). 

- `nsa_sample/lsbg_cutout_nsa.sh`: Bash script for downloading the NSA MW-like sample. Files will be downloaded to `$DATADIR/Cutout`. Index column is named `viz-id`.  The catalogs is generated in `nsa_sample/nsa_sample_cutout.ipynb` (adaptive cutout size based on magnitude and size).
